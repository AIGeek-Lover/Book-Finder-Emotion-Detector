ðŸ“š Book Recommendation & Emotion Detection:

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that leverages Dylan J. Castilloâ€™s book dataset and applies two powerful NLP models to deliver personalized book recommendations along with emotion analysis.

To find a suitable book based on a user's text query, the model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is used for semantic similarity search.

To conduct sentiment and emotion analysis on the recommended bookâ€™s description, the model j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base is used.
